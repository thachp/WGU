Introduction:

As a professional in the information technology industry, it is important to be able to present yourself online. One way to do this is by creating an online portfolio that not only introduces yourself but also demonstrates what you can do with the skills you have learned in this course.

For this project, you will create a website with at least four pages. The home page will be called index.html. It will contain an introduction, an explanation of what your site is about, graphics, and links to the other pages. Additionally, you will need to think of subtopics. Each of the other pages will be about one of the subtopics you choose.

One example of a website you could build would be to create a website about yourself. Some examples of subtopics you could use for such a topic may include, but are not limited to, the following:

•  career goals
•  school
•  work experience
•  areas of expertise
•  volunteer work

The goal is to show what you can do with HTML and CSS. You may select any topic for your website, so long as you complete all the HTML and CSS requirements listed in the Project Requirements.

As you create your website, you will use one external style sheet for the design and layout of your site. All the pages in the website will use the same external style sheet. Each page should have the same layout to keep a consistent feel throughout the site.

Note: All the code in your submission must be original work. You may not use pre-made templates of any sort including the templates provided in the Lynda.com exercise files, blog software such as a Blogger and WordPress, or content management systems like Joomla and PHP Nuke, or GUI web design software like Adobe Dreamweaver or any type of WYSIWYG application.


The layout of your page will be created using div tags named with an ID or class and the semantic elements (nav, header, section, aside). You can use float, width, height, clear, position, and other CSS properties to position the elements however you choose provided you meet the requirements below.

You will host this site on a web server of your choosing. You can pay to use the hosting sites such as those demonstrated in Lynda.com or any other paid site of your choosing. You also have the option to utilize free hosting sites to upload your website.

Note: Because your site will be live, use caution with the content and images of your website. The public will have access to your website, so do not include any sensitive/private information.

Requirements:

A.  Create an original layout template for your website by adhering to the guidelines below:

Note: The layout of your main elements will remain the same on each page, but you will customize the content on each of the subpages.

Note: You will be required to submit a hand-drawn or computer-generated sketch of the main layout template for your website on the attached “Student Project Submission Form.” The sketch should match the layout of your elements.

1.  Include each of the following semantic elements in your HTML template:
a.  header – a headline to describe the site
b.  nav – place the links to navigate throughout the site
c.  section – display the main content of the page

2.  Design your template with a consistent look and feel by using each of the following elements:
a.  external style sheet – position and style the areas of your website with no syntax errors
b.  float property – position at least one element (such as left or right) to the side of another in your layout
c.  absolute positioning – in at least one area (such as nav buttons, images, etc.) of your layout
d.  relative positioning – in at least one area (such as the main content) of your layout
e.  hover pseudo class – create a rollover effect for nav buttons

b.  one HTML coded ordered list with at least three items
c.  one HTML coded unordered list with at least three items
d.  one HTML coded table to organize content
3.  Include the following CSS rules to enhance your website content:
a.  at least two font changes (e.g., color, style)
b.  at least two type selectors to style HTML elements (e.g., p, table, th, td, ul, ol, li, h1-h6, a)
c.  at least two class selectors to style HTML elements of a page (e.g., img.photo, .clear, .emphasis) that are used at least two times in the HTML
d.  at least two ID selectors to format specific elements of a page (e.g., #container, #address, #logo)

C.  Upload your website to a hosting site by adhering to the guidelines below.
1.  Include the following in the hosted website you created in parts A, B, and C:
a.  a URL that can be accessed to view your website

c.  all images so they are correctly displayed on each web page
d.  functionality of all links, with no dead links
e.  functioning rollover effect for all nav buttons
f.  navigation ability between website pages so that each page is accessible from any page without the use of the browser’s back button

Note: In a browser, make sure the URL you chose for your site is working. Make sure all links and rollover effects work. Verify that your layout is correct and that all images show up.

D.  Submit a completed copy of the attached “Student Project Submission Form” that includes the following elements:
1.  the URL for the website you created in part B
2.  the browser and browser version used to test your website
3.  a sketch of the layout template you created in part A

E.  Submit one zipped file of your project with all files and images used to create your website.

F.  When you use sources, include all in-text citations and references in APA format.

Note: Common items to cite in building websites is copied text content, images, or diagrams. You must give proper credit and cite the source according to APA guidelines.

Note: For definitions of terms commonly used in the rubric, see the Rubric Terms web link included in the Evaluation Procedures section.

Note: When using sources to support ideas and elements in a paper or project, the submission MUST include APA formatted in-text citations with a corresponding reference list for any direct quotes or paraphrasing. It is not necessary to list sources that were consulted if they have not been quoted or paraphrased in the text of the paper or project.

Note: No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from outside sources, even if cited correctly. For tips on using APA style, please refer to the APA Handout web link included in the APA Guidelines section.
